build base Support Vector Machines(svm). it should be a simple one.
have an array to store the weight of different datasets
split one dataset into 1000 different datasets
run the svm on each dataset 
store the parameters of the svm in the array
repeat for all datasets, each time storing the weights in the array
after all datasets, average the weights from the array. 
set weight=avg(weight)
continue this for n number of iterations

so these are the steps to build the code. use this to write the code in python
